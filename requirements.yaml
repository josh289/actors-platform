## Actor Communication Patterns

### Internal Platform Communication
- actor_registry <-> mcp_coordinator: Pattern and code retrieval
- project_manager <-> deployment_engine: Deployment orchestration
- developer_portal <-> actor_registry: Browse and download actors
- mcp_coordinator <-> project_manager: Project context and generation

### External Actor Communication
- user_auth -> notifications: Send verification emails
- stripe_billing -> notifications: Payment confirmations
- All actors -> analytics: Event tracking
- stripe_billing <-> user_auth: Customer association

## Quality Requirements

1. Performance:
   - Sub-200ms API response times
   - Actor load time < 50ms
   - Search results < 100ms

2. Reliability:
   - 99.9% uptime SLA
   - Zero-downtime deployments
   - Automatic failover

3. Scalability:
   - Support 1M+ actor invocations/day
   - 10K+ concurrent developers
   - Unlimited actor storage

4. Security:
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Secure actor sandboxing
   - API key management
   - Audit logging
