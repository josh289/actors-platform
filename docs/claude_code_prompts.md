## Phase-Specific Prompt Templates

### Phase 1: Business Requirements Analysis

```markdown
# Phase 1 Prompt: Business Requirements Analysis

I'm starting Phase 1 of the BMAD-Actor framework to analyze your business requirements and identify the optimal actor architecture.

## Current Phase: Business Requirements Analysis
**Goal**: Decompose your project into well-defined actors with clear boundaries and responsibilities.

## What I Need From You:
1. **Project Description**: What are you building? (2-3 sentences)
2. **Target Users**: Who will use this system? (customers, admins, etc.)
3. **Core Features**: What are the main capabilities needed?
4. **Success Metrics**: How will you measure success?

## What I'll Deliver:
1. **Actor Identification**: List of business domains that become actors
2. **Boundary Analysis**: Clear data ownership and responsibility for each actor
3. **User Journey Mapping**: How user actions flow through actors
4. **Component Planning**: UI components each actor will export
5. **Validation Report**: Confirmation each actor passes responsibility tests

## Actor Responsibility Tests I Apply:
- [ ] Owns distinct business domain and data
- [ ] Has business rules that change independently  
- [ ] Needs to scale separately from other components
- [ ] Represents cohesive business capability
- [ ] Would make sense as a microservice
- [ ] Can be developed by 2-3 person team

## Example Output Format:
```yaml
project_analysis:
  domain: "E-commerce Platform"
  actors:
    - name: "user"
      purpose: "Manages user authentication and profiles"
      data_owned: ["profiles", "sessions", "preferences"]
      business_rules: ["unique email", "password requirements"]
    - name: "product" 
      purpose: "Manages product catalog and inventory"
      data_owned: ["products", "categories", "stock levels"]
      business_rules: ["stock validation", "pricing rules"]
```

**Ready to proceed? Please provide your project requirements.**
```

### Phase 2: Model Design

```markdown
# Phase 2 Prompt: Model Design

Excellent! Phase 1 analysis complete. Moving to Phase 2: Model Design.

## Current Phase: Model Design  
**Goal**: Create complete actor specifications with state schemas, event definitions, and component exports.

## What I'm Designing:
1. **State Schemas**: TypeScript/Zod schemas for what each actor owns
2. **Event Schemas**: Commands, Queries, and Notifications with proper typing
3. **Dependency Mapping**: How actors communicate (ask/tell/publish patterns)
4. **Component Architecture**: UI exports for web and mobile
5. **Integration Points**: External service boundaries and patterns

## Design Principles I Follow:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each data field has exactly one owner
- **Event-Driven**: All state changes happen through events
- **Component Isolation**: UI components are self-contained
- **Async by Default**: Use async patterns unless sync is required
- **Failure Resilience**: Graceful degradation when dependencies fail

## Validation Checks I Perform:
- [ ] No circular dependencies between actors
- [ ] All events follow naming conventions (VERB_NOUN, GET_NOUN, NOUN_VERB_PAST)
- [ ] State can be reconstructed from events
- [ ] Components have minimal, well-typed props
- [ ] External service boundaries are clear

## Sample Output (per actor):
```typescript
// State Schema
const UserStateSchema = z.object({
  users: z.record(z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    email: z.string(),
    profile: z.object({...}),
    roles: z.array(z.string())
  }))
});

// Event Schemas
const UserCommands = {
  SEND_MAGIC_LINK: z.object({
    email: z.string().email()
  })
};

// Component Exports
const UserComponents = {
  web: ['LoginForm', 'UserProfile', 'UserAvatar'],
  mobile: ['LoginScreen', 'ProfileScreen']
};
```

**Phase 2 deliverable**: Complete actor model specifications ready for architecture design.
```

### Phase 3: Architecture Design

```markdown
# Phase 3 Prompt: Architecture Design

Phase 2 model design complete! Moving to Phase 3: Architecture Design.

## Current Phase: Architecture Design
**Goal**: Design the complete system architecture for scalable, resilient deployment.

## Architecture Decisions I'm Making:
1. **Deployment Strategy**: Vercel-first with optional Kubernetes scaling
2. **Communication Patterns**: Event-driven with clear ask/tell/publish flows
3. **Data Strategy**: Event sourcing where beneficial, CRUD where appropriate
4. **Security Model**: Authentication, authorization, and audit patterns
5. **Performance Targets**: Response times, throughput, and scaling thresholds

## Architecture Patterns I Apply:
- **Microservices Pattern**: Each actor can scale independently
- **Event Sourcing**: For actors needing audit trails and replay capability
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write paths for performance
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience for external service calls
- **Bulkhead**: Failure isolation between actors

## Performance Targets I Set:
- **Response Time**: < 200ms p95 for API calls
- **Throughput**: 1000+ requests/second per actor
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime target
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on load

## Sample Architecture Output:
```yaml
deployment_architecture:
  platform: "vercel"
  communication_flows:
    - flow: "User Registration"
      steps:
        - actor: "user"
          event: "SEND_MAGIC_LINK"
          pattern: "command"
        - actor: "notification" 
          event: "SEND_EMAIL"
          pattern: "tell"
        - actor: "analytics"
          event: "TRACK_EVENT"
          pattern: "tell"
          
  security_model:
    authentication: "magic-link + JWT"
    authorization: "role-based"
    audit_trail: "event-sourced"
```

**Phase 3 deliverable**: Complete system architecture ready for implementation.
```

### Phase 4: Development Implementation

```markdown
# Phase 4 Prompt: Development Implementation

Architecture design approved! Moving to Phase 4: Development Implementation.

## Current Phase: Development Implementation
**Goal**: Generate complete, production-ready code with comprehensive testing.

## Code Generation Strategy:
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implementation
2. **Actor Core**: State management, event handlers, integrations
3. **UI Components**: React/React Native with proper TypeScript
4. **API Layer**: GraphQL schema and resolvers
5. **Configuration**: Deployment configs and environment setup

## Code Quality Standards I Enforce:
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ for all actor code
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with strict mode
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle sizes and runtime performance
- **Security**: Input validation, sanitization, and secure patterns
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant UI components

## Implementation Order:
1. **Core Actors**: Generate fundamental business logic actors first
2. **Supporting Actors**: Build notification, analytics, etc.
3. **UI Components**: Create all web and mobile components
4. **Integration Layer**: Connect to external services
5. **Deployment Pipeline**: Set up automated deployment

## Sample Generated Code Structure:
```
my-app/
├── actors/
│   ├── user/
│   │   ├── src/index.ts              # Actor definition
│   │   ├── handlers/                 # Event handlers

## Integration Prompts for MCP Tools

### Business Requirements Analysis Tool

```markdown
# MCP Tool: analyze_business_requirements

## Purpose
Analyze project requirements and decompose into well-defined actors using BMAD domain analysis principles.

## Input Schema
```json
{
  "project_description": "string - 2-3 sentence description of what you're building",
  "target_users": "array - list of user types (customers, admins, etc.)",
  "core_features": "array - main capabilities needed",
