# Test Status Summary

## Current State

### What Works
1. Basic vitest setup is functional
2. Simple unit tests can run successfully  
3. SDK builds (JavaScript/ESM) but without TypeScript declarations
4. Workspace dependencies installed with workaround

### What Doesn't Work
1. Component tests fail due to missing @testing-library/react
2. SDK tests fail due to missing /testing export path
3. TypeScript declaration generation fails due to type errors
4. Cannot install new dependencies due to workspace:* protocol issues

## Test Results

```
Simple Test: ✓ PASSED (2/2 tests)
Component Tests: ✗ FAILED (missing dependencies)
Integration Tests: ✗ FAILED (import errors)
```

## Root Causes

1. **Workspace Protocol**: npm workspace:* protocol creates circular dependency issues
2. **Missing Test Infrastructure**: No proper test setup for React components
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Multiple type incompatibilities in SDK preventing clean builds
4. **Incomplete Exports**: SDK missing proper export configuration for testing utilities

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: 
   - Fix TypeScript errors in SDK to enable declaration generation
   - Create proper mock setup for component tests
   - Fix SDK export paths

2. **Short Term**:
   - Replace workspace:* with explicit versions or file: paths
   - Set up proper test infrastructure with all dependencies
   - Create integration test suite

3. **Long Term**:
   - Migrate to pnpm or yarn for better monorepo support
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Add e2e tests

## Components Implemented

All 13 UI components have been implemented:
- ✓ Web: AuthStatus, UserAvatar, LoginPage, ProfilePage, SecurityDashboard, LoginModal, SessionManager, LoginButton, LogoutButton, AuthGuard
- ✓ Mobile: ProfileScreen, SecurityScreen, AuthCard

However, none can be properly tested due to infrastructure issues.
