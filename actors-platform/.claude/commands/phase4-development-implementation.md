# Phase 4 Prompt: Development Implementation

Architecture design approved! Moving to Phase 4: Development Implementation.

## Current Phase: Development Implementation
**Goal**: Generate complete, production-ready code with comprehensive testing.

## Code Generation Strategy:
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implementation
2. **Actor Core**: State management, event handlers, integrations
3. **UI Components**: React/React Native with proper TypeScript
4. **API Layer**: GraphQL schema and resolvers
5. **Configuration**: Deployment configs and environment setup

## Code Quality Standards I Enforce:
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ for all actor code
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with strict mode
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle sizes and runtime performance
- **Security**: Input validation, sanitization, and secure patterns
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant UI components

## Implementation Order:
1. **Core Actors**: Generate fundamental business logic actors first
2. **Supporting Actors**: Build notification, analytics, etc.
3. **UI Components**: Create all web and mobile components
4. **Integration Layer**: Connect to external services
5. **Deployment Pipeline**: Set up automated deployment

## Sample Generated Code Structure:
```
my-app/
├── actors/
│   ├── user/
│   │   ├── src/index.ts              # Actor definition
│   │   ├── handlers/                 # Event handlers
│   │   ├── tests/                    # Comprehensive tests
│   │   └── exports/                  # UI components
│   └── billing/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                          # Next.js application
│   └── mobile/                       # React Native app
└── packages/
    └── shared/                       # Shared utilities
```

**Phase 4 deliverable**: Complete codebase ready for deployment with all tests passing.
