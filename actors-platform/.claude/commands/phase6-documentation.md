# Phase 6 Prompt: Documentation

System successfully deployed! Moving to Phase 6: Documentation.

## Current Phase: Documentation
**Goal**: Create comprehensive documentation for long-term maintainability and team knowledge transfer.

## Documentation Package I Create:
1. **Technical Documentation**: Architecture, APIs, deployment procedures
2. **User Documentation**: Quick start guides, tutorials, examples
3. **Operational Documentation**: Monitoring, troubleshooting, maintenance
4. **Knowledge Management**: Decision logs, lessons learned, future plans

## Documentation Standards:
- **Completeness**: Every feature and component documented
- **Clarity**: Written for different audience levels
- **Currency**: Documentation stays up-to-date with code
- **Searchability**: Well-organized with clear navigation
- **Examples**: Practical examples for all major features

## Documentation Deliverables:
